  Interlectual property in China</h1>
<h3> The Interllectual property in China needs to be more enforeced a lot more than what it is right now. People are taking and stealing a lot of products such as elctronics and cars and making fake versions of these. What I think they need to do tostop this is to enforce it more because if people see they don't get punished then they'lll just keep doing it.</h3>
